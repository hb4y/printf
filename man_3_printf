.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The _printf besides receiving a string of charaters it can also receive what we call 
.I conversion specifiers.
In this case, insted of receive a string of chars, the argument will receive the % char followed
by a conversion specifier that is a single character (It has to be inside double quotes "%specifier"). Depending on the type it will print the corresponding output.
.sp
.PP
After the % followed by the specifier, a comma (,) will separate it from the next argument that must be avariable that has the same type of the char specifier.
.sp
.B Example

To invoke the function passing specifiers to it:
.sp
_printf("%specifier", variable of type specifier);
